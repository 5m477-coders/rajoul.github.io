## Vulnhub Writeups

I've been doing Virtual Machines from past 4 months. Some of them I've done by myself and some of them were done along with [motley crew](https://twitter.com/m0tl3ycr3w).

Usually I do writeups for any VM that I solve.

Here's the list of all the VMs I've solved.

# Machine
* Basic_pentest
* Null byte
* brainpan
* kioptrix_1
